# Dyslexia Helper – Browser Extension

Built for CodeRush 2025

A lightweight, privacy-friendly browser extension that makes reading the web easier for people with dyslexia (and anyone who loves cleaner pages).  
It lets you adjust text spacing, switch to dyslexia-friendly fonts, play calming focus sounds, and convert any selected text to natural-sounding speech.

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. **Content Script + CSS:** injects custom styles (spacing, fonts) into every page.
2. **Web Audio API:** plays locally stored or generated **brown / white / rain** noise.
3. **Web Speech API:** powers **text-to-speech** with adjustable voices & speed.
4. **Manifest v3:** keeps the extension lightweight, secure, and Chrome/Edge-compatible.
